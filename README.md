## Cognitive Modeling - _Project Portfolio_
### _By Aleksander Frese and Sebastian Sbirna_
---
This repository contains the collection of projects made for the DTU Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence course: _Cognitive Modeling_.

Theories of cognition, seen from an information-processing perspective, have been implemented into quantitative models throughout these projects. More specifically, models of attention, memory and perception are discussed, including their commonalities and variations. We evaluate these models based on empirical and simulated data using mathematical analysis programs (mainly MATLAB).

By using knowledge from the field of Cognitive Science, Neuroscience and IT technologies, we are able to summarize different brain processes in a mathematical or computational form. Within these projects, we have focused on:

• Bayesian Models of visual perception
• Face perception modeling
• Signal detection theory
• PCA/ICA for edge detection and dimensionality reduction
• Psychometric functions
• Psychophysics
