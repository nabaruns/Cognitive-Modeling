## Cognitive Modeling - _Project Portfolio_
### _By Aleksander Frese and Sebastian Sbirna_
---
This repository contains the collection of projects made for the DTU Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence course: _Cognitive Modeling_.

Theories of cognition, seen from an information-processing perspective, have been implemented into ___quantitative models___ throughout these projects. More specifically, __models of _attention, memory and perception___ are discussed, including their commonalities and variations. We evaluate these models based on __empirical and simulated data using mathematical analysis programs (mainly MATLAB)__.

By using knowledge from the field of _Cognitive Science_, _Neuroscience_ and _IT technologies_, we are able to ___summarize different brain processes in a mathematical or computational form___. Within these projects, we have focused on:

#### • Bayesian Models of visual perception <br>
#### • Face perception modeling <br>
#### • Signal detection theory <br>
#### • PCA/ICA for edge detection and dimensionality reduction <br>
#### • Psychometric functions <br>
#### • Psychophysics <br>
